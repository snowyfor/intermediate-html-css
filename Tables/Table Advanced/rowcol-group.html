    this is 'scope' alternative

    in long header="" The order of the specified ids doesn't matter, but you should be consistent to keep it organized.

     This method creates very precise associations between headers and data cells but it uses a lot more markup and does not leave any room for errors.
     The scope approach is usually sufficient for most tables.
